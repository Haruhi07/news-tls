The popular uprisings against longtime strongmen in Tunisia and now Egypt have triggered aftershocks around the Middle East and North Africa as authoritarian rulers move to head off similar uprisings in their own nations . Here 's a summary of what has happened elsewhere : President Abdelaziz Bouteflika will lift a nearly 20-year - old state of emergency in the ` ` very close future , '' the state news agency announced Thursday . The move is one of several demanded by demonstrators in recent protests against the government , which imposed the emergency decree in a crackdown against Islamic political parties in 1992 . The clampdown triggered an Islamist insurgency that left more than 100,000 dead , according to human rights groups . Those taking to the streets in recent demonstrations have also called for the release of prisoners and the restoration of individual and collective freedoms .

There were immediate suspicions that the pro - Mubarak demonstrators were not simply average citizens standing up for the man who has led Egypt for three decades -- suspicions that proved at least partly founded . Heavy gunfire reverberated in central Cairo before dawn Thursday as supporters and foes of embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak continued to face off at Tahrir Square , where chunks of concretes and Molotov cocktails were employed as weapons in the escalating crisis . CNN personnel saw wounded people being carried into Tahrir Square , largely held by anti - regime demonstrators , through an entrance that leads to the nearby Egyptian Museum . Several ambulances entered and left the square shortly before 4 a.m. Thursday . The source of the gunfire was not immediately known .
